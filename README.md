*Proof that aliens love SpaceX rockets.*

## 📡 Project Overview
This dashboard explores the *totally scientific* relationship between UFO sightings, SpaceX launches, military bases, and pop culture. Use the interactive map to:
- 🔍 Spot UFO hotspots (or swamp gas clusters).
- 🚀 See if Elon Musk is accidentally summoning aliens.
- 🎖️ Judge whether Area 51 is *still* not suspicious.

**Disclaimer**: This project is 50% data science, 50% tinfoil hat, and 100% sarcasm. No aliens were harmed in the making.
