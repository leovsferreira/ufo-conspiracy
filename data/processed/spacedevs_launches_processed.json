The craft was equipped with an inflatable airlock in order to conduct the first ever spacewalk. Alexey Leonov became the first person to do so by performing a 12 minute spacewalk. The mission lasted 1 day, 2 hours, 2 minutes & 17 seconds completing a total of 17 orbits around Earth. The mission had many issues, for example during his spacewalk his spacesuit ballooned up to a point where his suit became stiff. In order to move his limbs again and re-enter the airlock he had to bleed off some of the suit's pressure. After re-entering the capsule,the crew had trouble sealing the hatch, during re-entry the orbital module did not properly disconnect from the landing module causing the spacecraft to spin wildly until turbulence caused them to separate at around 100 km and the automatic landing system failed and the crew had to rely on the manual backup.

They stayed on the station for 63 days setting a new Soviet space endurance record at the time. Klimuk & Sevastyanov were the back-up crew for the failed Soyuz 18a mission so their mission goals included completing the goals of Soyuz 18a, continuing the work of Soyuz 17 & fixing or replacing equipment. They replaced a gas analyzer, switched a pumping condenser in the water regeneration system with a hand pump & fixed a spectrometer. Mostly the experiments were biological & medical but they also studied stars, planets, earth and its atmosphere with roughly 2000 photographs of Earth and 600 of the sun taken.

During their stay on the station, crew conducted scientific experiments, inculding the first use of Kristall furnace for crystal growth, solar observations and experiments of military nature.\nThe mission was expected to last for 60 days, but emergincies occured on the 42nd day, which included shutdown of several onboard systems, oxygen regeneration system among those. Crew restored functionality of the spaceship, but both Volynov and Zholobov's health was deteriorated, and mission had to end early. \nThe mission concluded after 49 days with a rough landing back on Earth on August 24, 1976, 18:32:17 UTC."},"launch_service_provider":{"id":66,"name":"Soviet Space Program"},"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.3.0/launches/9a7ceb6c-8d03-4d49-b322-24d7d9d8b98d/"},{"id":"6bcb4ac5-3477-430a-91be-ece9c352131b","name":"Titan IIID | KH-9 12","net":"07/08/1976 18:30","status":"Success","rocket_id":4728,"pad":{"id":16,"name":"Space Launch Complex 4E","latitude":34.632,"longitude":-120.611},"mission":{"name":"KH-9 12","type":"Government/Top Secret","description":"Large reconnaissance satellite equipped with four return capsules."},"launch_service_provider":{"id":161,"name":"United States Air Force"},"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.3.0/launches/6bcb4ac5-3477-430a-91be-ece9c352131b/"},{"id":"d7a5ffa6-6fb6-4212-8121-73c70ca3f6e0","name":"Kosmos-3M | DS-P1-M 9 (Kosmos-839)","net":"07/08/1976 21:08","status":"Success","rocket_id":4729,"pad":{"id":28,"name":"132/1 (132L)","latitude":62.883229,"longitude":40.868549},"mission":{"name":"DS-P1-M 9","type":"Test Target","description":"ASAT target satellite"},"launch_service_provider":{"id":66,"name":"Soviet Space Program"},"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.3.0/launches/d7a5ffa6-6fb6-4212-8121-73c70ca3f6e0/"},{"id":"f2857a6e-5c74-4804-9764-9fdbd1eb0c83","name":"Delta 2914 | Palapa A1","net":"07/08/1976 23:31","status":"Success","rocket_id":4730,"pad":{"id":14,"name":"Space Launch Complex 17A","latitude":28.4472,"longitude":-80.565},"mission":{"name":"Palapa A1","type":"Communications","description":"Indonesia communications satellite"},"launch_service_provider":{"id":161,"name":"United States Air Force"},"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.3.0/launches/f2857a6e-5c74-4804-9764-9fdbd1eb0c83/"},{"id":"d0019b28-4d6b-4d84-9b99-ef55c98bbc1e","name":"Soyuz U | Zenit-2M 69","net":"07/14/1976 09:00","status":"Success","rocket_id":4731,"pad":{"id":85,"name":"43/4 (43R)","latitude":62.92883,"longitude":40.457098},"mission":{"name":"Zenit-2M 69","type":"Government/Top Secret","description":"The soviet Zenit-2M (Gektor, 11F690) was an improved version of the Zenit-2 area surveillance reconnaissance satellite.
